#' jqr: An R client for the C library jq
#'
#' \code{\link{jq}} and \code{\link{jq_}} are the most important functions.
#' \code{\link{jq}} is meant to work with the high level interface in this
#' package. \code{\link{jq_}} provides access to the low level interface
#' in which you can use jq query strings just as you would on the command
#' line.
