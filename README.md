R interface to jq http://stedolan.github.io/jq/

To install, after cloning the repo the first time, run (from the command line)

```
./bootstrap.R
```

which will download the 1.4 release of [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  This does not need to be run on subsequent runs, and will stop being required once [this issue](https://github.com/ropensci/jqr/issues/1) is resolved.

```r
library("jqr")
```



```r

```
